To run the program, the following items should be located in the same folder/directory:

1. The Java Program, "stabbert_Keith_hw3.java"
2. The JDBC driver, "mysql-connector-java-5.1.27-bin.jar"
3. The run script, "stabbert_Keith_hw3.sh"

When running the program from the Linux command-line, first "cd" to the directory/folder where the above 3 files are located. 

THE FOLLOWING COMMAND WILL COMPILE AND RUN THE PROGRAM!

./stabbert_Keith_hw3.sh


This will compile the Java program and run the Java program with the JDBC driver on the classpath.
When the program has finished running, the compiled "stabbert_Keith_hw3.class" file will be automatically removed.
